# Safe Steer 🚗✨

## Driving Safety Reimagined

## Overview

Safe Steer is a revolutionary driver monitoring system that transforms ordinary steering wheels into intelligent safety guardians. Using an integrated network of advanced sensors and a high-definition camera, Safe Steer continuously monitors driver alertness and behavior to prevent accidents before they happen.

## How It Works

Safe Steer combines hardware and software in a seamless integration:

1. **Smart Steering Wheel**: Equipped with pressure sensors, motion detectors, and a driver-facing camera
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Detects signs of drowsiness, distraction, or impaired driving
3. **Instant Alerts**: Provides immediate feedback to drivers when attention wavers
4. **Family Connection**: Streams critical safety data to loved ones via Firebase

## Key Features

- **Drowsiness Detection**: Identifies early signs of driver fatigue through eye tracking and steering patterns
- **Distraction Monitoring**: Detects when a driver's attention strays from the road
- **Firebase Integration**: Securely transmits driving data to authorized family members
- **Real-time Alerts**: Provides both in-vehicle warnings and remote notifications
- **Easy Installation**: Compatible with most modern vehicles
- **Privacy Controls**: Drivers maintain control over what information is shared
